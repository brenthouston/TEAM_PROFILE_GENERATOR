## Description
   This is an application that prompts you via node.js.  The prompts ask questions about your team and it auto populates a webpage with your information. This project was built to quickly populate team information in an attractive demonstration. Inquirer was used to handle user prompting. I implemented test-driven development using jest. In completing this project I learned about instance inheritance, module exports, object Polymorphism, .then promises, and recursive functions.
