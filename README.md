## Description
   This is an application that prompts you via node.js.  The prompts ask questions about your team and it auto populates a webpage with your information. I built this project to keep my manager and employees information in a convienent place. I used inquirer to handle prompting the user. I implemented test-driven development using jest. In completing this project I learned about instance inheritance, Polymorphism, .then promises, and recursive functions.
